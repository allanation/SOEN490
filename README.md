# Welcome to our SOEN 490 Capstone Project: "What's Up?"

“What’s Up?” is a platform specifically designed for University students, which works to display a series of events hosted by the school which they attend to. This project is designed and implemented for our graduating course's Capstone project, SOEN 490, at Concordia University.

Be sure to check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/jasminelebel/SOEN490/wiki) for more information on the agile development behind this project's implementation.
